# Data-Exploration
Advance Data Science - using Python

Data exploration is the first step in data analysis involving the use of data visualization tools and statistical techniques to uncover data set characteristics and initial patterns.

During exploration, raw data is typically reviewed with a combination of manual workflows and automated data-exploration techniques to visually explore data sets, look for similarities, patterns and outliers and to identify the relationships between different variables.

This is also sometimes referred to as exploratory data analysis, which is a statistical technique employed to analyze raw data sets in search of their broad characteristics.

* Data Visualization
Data visualization always helps to understand the data easily. Python has libraries like matplotlib and seaborn to create multiple graphs effectively.

* Frequency Tables
Frequency Tables can be used to understand the distribution of a categorical variable or n categorical variables using frequency tables.
